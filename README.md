## 4.2 Run
As we used micro-service architecture, so we got many micro-services. For now, each micro-service is build with spring-boot. 
You can run on your local machine, or run it on your k8s cluster(we recommend this way).

Step one: you should got an git repo for keep our configs(or you just keep the config on your local)

Step two: config the config-service, and then start up the config-service.(just as run an spring-boot project)

Step three: run the service you need.
